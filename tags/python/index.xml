      <description>In fact, I had been working on a similar project for some time. Although I tried to complete it, I eventually gave up because it was too complex and inefficient to move forward with. So I decided to restart the project from scratch.&#xA;1. Project Tech Stack Area Tech Backend Python(FastAPI), Redis, Redis Queue(RQ), PostgreSQL Frontend React + Vite Infra Docker, Docker Compose, .env, .yml 2. Backend Settings 2.1 backend.DockerFile This DockerFile installs backend system dependencies and Python packaging tool(uv) for the Python 3.12.11 environment.</description>

      <title>3. Logger Configuration</title>

      <description>For operating this project reliably, I need a robust logging system. So I decided the Loguru library for its simplicity and powerful features. The configuration was customized to meet the following requirements:&#xA;Custom Log Formatting Example:&#xA;2025-06-26 23:09:24 | INFO | main :lifespan :16 - Starting up the application... Persistent Log Files&#xA;Save logs using filenames that include the current date. Retain logs for 7 days only. Integration with FastAPI and Uvicorn Logs</description>

      <title>8. Login Log</title>

      <description>In this section, I’ll explain how I implemented the login log functionality. Since this is a single-user application, logging each login might seem unnecessary at first. However, I decided to build this feature to enhance security and maintain visibility over all login activities. Recording login attempts allows me to track unauthorized access or unexpected behavior in the system.&#xA;1. The design of the login log function 1.1 Diagram The diagram below illustrates the communication flow between the frontend, backend, and Database during a login process.</description>

      <title>14. Makefile Setup</title>
      <link>https://blackjjw.github.io/multi-crypto-trading-tool/dev-logs/makefilesetup/index.html</link>

      <description>This project consists of multiple languages, so each one has its own set of commands. I often mix them up. To address this, I decided to add a Makefile for each language. Using Makefiles helps keep command execution consistent across languages.&#xA;1. Makefile in the Backend This Makefile is for Python with uv.&#xA;# basic target .PHONY: run freeze test # Start FastAPI server run: uv run src/main.py # Update requirements.txt freeze: uv pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt test: PYTHONPATH=./src uv run -m pytest 2. Makefile in the Frontend This Makefile is for React with npm.</description>
