      <description>In this section, Iâ€™ll explain how I implemented the login log functionality. Since this is a single-user application, logging each login might seem unnecessary at first. However, I decided to build this feature to enhance security and maintain visibility over all login activities. Recording login attempts allows me to track unauthorized access or unexpected behavior in the system.&#xA;1. The design of the login log function 1.1 Diagram The diagram below illustrates the communication flow between the frontend, backend, and Database during a login process.</description>

      <description>This refactoring was performed to improve separation of concerns and make authentication logic more modular and testable.&#xA;Previously, authentication logic (authenticate_user) was part of the UserService, tightly coupling user management and auth logic.&#xA;Now, that logic has been moved into a dedicated AuthService, and the login route has been migrated from user_router to a new auth_router.&#xA;1. AuthService I extracted a new service class for authentication. The authenticate_user() method, previously in UserService, is now moved to AuthService.</description>
