      <description>This refactoring was performed to improve separation of concerns and make authentication logic more modular and testable.&#xA;Previously, authentication logic (authenticate_user) was part of the UserService, tightly coupling user management and auth logic.&#xA;Now, that logic has been moved into a dedicated AuthService, and the login route has been migrated from user_router to a new auth_router.&#xA;1. AuthService I extracted a new service class for authentication. The authenticate_user() method, previously in UserService, is now moved to AuthService.</description>

      <description>This refactoring adopts asynchronous database management to avoid blocking caused by synchronous I/O.&#xA;Previously, database access was implemented synchronously across services and endpoints, which could block under concurrent workloads. Because this program needs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, I decided to switch to an async-first approach for database operations.&#xA;1. Config To enable asynchronous PostgreSQL support, install asyncpg:&#xA;uv pip install asyncpg In config.py, I added the following property to build the async SQLAlchemy URL for PostgreSQL:</description>
