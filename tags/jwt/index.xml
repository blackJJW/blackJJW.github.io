      <description>In this section, I’ll explain how I made the login function. This project is designed as a single-user program. In other words, only the administrator is authorized to access and operate the system. Therefore, I created a single account with the ID: “admin”.&#xA;1. The design of the login function 1.1 Diagram This shows the communication between the frontend, backend, and DB.</description>

      <title>9. Refactoring 1: Backend - Separate AuthService and Move Login API</title>

      <description>This refactoring was performed to improve separation of concerns and make authentication logic more modular and testable.&#xA;Previously, authentication logic (authenticate_user) was part of the UserService, tightly coupling user management and auth logic.&#xA;Now, that logic has been moved into a dedicated AuthService, and the login route has been migrated from user_router to a new auth_router.&#xA;1. AuthService I extracted a new service class for authentication. The authenticate_user() method, previously in UserService, is now moved to AuthService.</description>

      <description>This post outlines the frontend design and implementation for API key management.&#xA;1. The design of the API Key Management 1.1 API Key Management Structure To visualize the layout, I sketched a simple diagram of the API Key management page.&#xA;Left-side Menu Items: Under Settings, several submenus are available.&#xA;Exchanges: Area for managing exchanges.&#xA;API Keys: Area for managing API keys.</description>

      <title>Securing API keys and secrets with Pydantic settings &#43; .env</title>

      <description>Secrets are easy to leak when the project grows. In this backend, I keep configuration and credentials centralized in a Pydantic Settings class and load them from .env. API keys are encrypted at rest, and JWT secrets never live in code.&#xA;This post documents the exact pattern used in this repo.&#xA;1. Centralized config with Pydantic settings All secrets are defined once in Settings and imported through a single settings instance:</description>
